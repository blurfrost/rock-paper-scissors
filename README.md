# rock-paper-scissors
Webpage which includes a rock paper scissors game of five rounds, built with HTML and JavaScript.

How to play:

Launch index.html on your web browser and enter the console in the webpage (Ctrl + Shift + J / Cmd + Shift + J)
The game will then start.

You will be prompted to enter either rock, paper or scissors for each round. (this is case insensitive).
Should you enter an invalid input, you will be prompted again.
Afterwards, the program will randomly generate one of these inputs and a result will be determined.
(Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper, Paper beats rock)

Five rounds will be conducted in total, after which the final score will be tabulated and the player with the highest score wins!
(If the scores are equal, it will be considered as a draw)
