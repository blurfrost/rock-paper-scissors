# rock-paper-scissors
Webpage which includes a rock paper scissors game of five rounds, built with HTML and JavaScript.

How to play:

Launch index.html on your web browser. The game will start immediately.
The user interface includes three buttons (rock, paper or scissors) to be chosen.
Clicking a button will enter your choice for a round of the game.
Afterwards, the program will randomly generate one of these inputs and a result will be determined.
(Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper, Paper beats rock)
The scoreboard below the buttons shows the result of the current round (including the current round number).

Five rounds will be conducted in total, after which the final score will be tabulated and the player with the highest score wins!
(If the scores are equal, it will be considered as a draw)
